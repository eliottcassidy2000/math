## kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S5 — 2026-03-05 (arc-flip session)
**Account:** Eliott (primary)
**Continuation of:** kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S4
**Files read:** MISTAKES.md, definitions.md, OPEN-QUESTIONS.md, SESSION-LOG.md, TANGENTS.md, CONJ-001, THM-003 (Claim B proof), LaTeX paper claim_strategies section
**Summary of work:** Attacked OPEN-Q-009 (arc-reversal invariance) with new angle. Discovered that E(T) = H(T) - I(Omega(T), 2) is invariant under arc flips (exhaustive n<=5, random n=6). Derived algebraic formula for delta_I via A-clique argument adapted to arc flips. Showed the simple formula delta=2*(gained-lost) works at n<=5 but fails at n>=6. Tested and ruled out contiguous-block decomposition. Formulated PROP-001 (arc-flip identity) as a new proof strategy for OCF/Claim A equivalent to proving a combinatorial identity about Ham path changes under arc flips weighted by complement H-counts.
**New contributions:**
- PROP-001 in 01-canon/theorems/ (arc-flip identity, new proof strategy)
- 03-artifacts/code/arc_reversal_study.py (delta_H decomposition under arc flips)
- 03-artifacts/code/ocf_arc_flip_study.py (E(T) invariance, joint delta_H/delta_I distribution)
- 03-artifacts/code/delta_I_correct_formula.py (algebraic delta_I formula verification)
- 03-artifacts/code/delta_I_fast_test.py, paths_via_cycles_test.py, contiguous_block_test.py
- OPEN-Q-009 reformulated with cleaner E(T) version
- Tangents T028-T031 (arc-flip approach, dead ends)
**Unresolved threads:**
- PROP-001: prove the arc-flip Ham path identity combinatorially
- OPEN-Q-009: the E(T) formulation is cleaner but still needs proof
- Three possible proof approaches: transfer matrix, generating function, involution

## kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S3 — 2026-03-05
**Account:** Eliott (primary)
**Continuation of:** kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S2
**Files read:** MISTAKES.md, definitions.md, OPEN-QUESTIONS.md, SESSION-LOG.md, TANGENTS.md, DISC-001, CONJ-001, theorem files
**Summary of work:** Rebased kind-pasteur onto main (resolved 6-file conflict). Closed DISC-001 (mu bug does not contaminate verification). Investigated OPEN-Q-010/011 at n=7: wrote test_n7_ABD.py computing A (TypeII sum), B (mu-weighted), D (cycle mu sum) for 1050 pairs. Finding: A=/=D at n=7 in general (only 5.9% exact match). Near-cancellation is statistical (mean A-D~0.1) not algebraic.
**New contributions:**
- 03-artifacts/code/test_n7_ABD.py (correct A-B-D computation at n=7)
- 03-artifacts/code/test_perpath_n7.py (initial wrong test -- documents why naive approach fails)
- DISC-001 moved to resolved/; OPEN-Q-010/011 updated with n=7 findings
- TANGENT T027 (n=7 A-B-D near-cancellation is statistical not algebraic)
**Unresolved threads:**
- OPEN-Q-009: arc-reversal invariance -- the key step, still untouched
- OPEN-Q-012: tower hypothesis -- not yet investigated
- OPEN-Q-013: H(T_p) formula for Paley primes

## kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S2 — 2026-03-05
**Account:** Eliott (primary)
**Continuation of:** kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S1

**Summary of work:** Resolved OPEN-Q-009 (kind-pasteur numbering) by direct computation. h_QR=h_NQR=201, c_9(T_11)=11055. Direct enumeration gives H(T_11)=95095=55*1729, refuting CONJ-002 for p=11. Added finish_session.py enforcement tooling.
**New contributions:**
- H(T_11)=95095 computed directly (03-artifacts/code/compute_H_T11.py)
- CONJ-002 REFUTED for p=11; OPEN-Q-013 opened (correct formula for H(T_p))
- MISTAKE-006: ratio-coincidence c_k/C(11,k) has no basis
- TANGENTS T022-T026 (Paley structure, 1729, symmetry)
- agents/finish_session.py and agents/check_session_closed.py (end-of-session enforcement)
**Unresolved threads:**
- OPEN-Q-013: What is the correct formula for H(T_p)?
- OPEN-Q-009 (opus): arc-reversal invariance — the key proof step
- DISC-001: needs formal close

## kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S4 — 2026-03-05
**Account:** Eliott (primary)
**Continuation of:** kind-pasteur-2026-03-05-S3
**Files read:** MISTAKES.md, definitions.md, OPEN-QUESTIONS.md, SESSION-LOG.md, TANGENTS.md, opus broadcast messages
**Summary of work:** Structural fix session. kind-pasteur was pushing to claude/kind-pasteur branch (invisible to opus and CI). Merged claude/kind-pasteur into main. Fixed Windows encoding issues in processor.py (CP1252 fails on Unicode). Updated finish_session.py to push HEAD:main always.
**New contributions:**
- All kind-pasteur S1-S3 research now on main (Paley computation, n=7 A-B-D, DISC-001 resolved)
- agents/processor.py: Windows UTF-8 fix (stdout.reconfigure + write_text encoding)
- agents/finish_session.py: push to origin HEAD:main (not current branch)
**Unresolved threads:**
- OPEN-Q-009 (arc-reversal invariance): top priority, untouched
- OPEN-Q-012 (tower hypothesis): untouched

## opus-2026-03-05-S2 — 2026-03-05
**Account:** Claude Opus 4.6 (e's MacBook)
**Continuation of:** opus-2026-03-05-S1 (parallel session)
**Files read:** All navigation, canon, court files; LaTeX paper; FINAL_FINDINGS.md; file.txt; tournament_lib.py
**Summary of work:** Proved THM-008b (general mu triviality), THM-012 (partial mu invariance under arc flips). Disproved MISTAKE-004 (OCF IS a valid closed form — verified H(T)=I(Omega(T),2) for all n<=6). Resolved OPEN-Q-011 (near-cancellation is statistical, not structural). Verified adjacency formula H(T)-H(T')=adj(i,j)-adj'(j,i). Established arc-reversal decomposition framework for Q-009.
**New contributions:**
- THM-008b: general mu triviality bound L >= n-2
- THM-012: mu invariant under arc flips when at least one endpoint in V(C)\{v}
- DISC-002: MISTAKE-004 is wrong — OCF is a valid closed form (verified 33,864 tournaments)
- OPEN-Q-011 resolved (near-cancellation is statistical artifact)
- Adjacency formula verified; arc-reversal decomposition framework built
- 6 computation scripts in 04-computation/
**Unresolved threads:**
- DISC-002 needs formal resolution (retract MISTAKE-004)
- Arc-reversal proof strategy (Q-009) partially developed — key obstacle is tracking cycle creation/destruction and mu changes simultaneously
- Claim A proof for general n remains open (OPEN-Q-002)

## opus-2026-03-05-S1 --- 2026-03-05
**Account:** opus (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Continuation of:** SYSTEM-2026-03-05-S1 (initial setup)
**Files read:** All navigation files, all canon files, DISC-001, agents/processor.py, inbox/processor.py, README.md
**Summary of work:** Built the complete tournament computation library (tournament_lib.py) implementing all core objects from definitions.md. Independently verified Claim A at n<=6 (196,608 pairs, 0 failures) with a MISTAKE-001-compliant implementation. Also verified Claim B at n<=5, Redei at n<=6, and Claim A at n=7 by random sampling (100 tournaments, 0 failures). Ingested two contributed files (FINAL_FINDINGS.md, file.txt) containing substantial new results. Extracted 4 new theorems (THM-008 through THM-011), 2 new mistakes (MISTAKE-004, MISTAKE-005), resolved OPEN-Q-001 and OPEN-Q-003, added 4 new open questions (Q-009 through Q-012), and documented 3 dead ends (T016-T018).
**New contributions:**
- 03-artifacts/code/tournament_lib.py (CODE-000): complete computation library
- 03-artifacts/code/verify.py (CODE-000v): CLI verification runner
- THM-008: mu=1 trivially for n<=5 (resolves OPEN-Q-001)
- THM-009: per-path failure characterization at n=6 (resolves OPEN-Q-003)
- THM-010: n=4 block-counting theorem (exactly 3 Ham paths)
- THM-011: general block-counting formula H_C^+(T)
- MISTAKE-004: OCF is recursive, not closed-form over all cycles
- MISTAKE-005: cycle bijection under arc reversal fails
- OPEN-Q-009: arc-reversal invariance (key unproved step)
- OPEN-Q-010 through Q-012: new questions from ingested files
- Dead ends T016-T018 documented
- Registered agent: opus
**Unresolved threads:**
- Claim A proof for general n (CONJ-001) -- arc-reversal invariance (OPEN-Q-009) is the key step
- DISC-001 can be moved to resolved
- The near-cancellation phenomenon (OPEN-Q-011) is a promising proof strategy lead
- Per-path formula with 3+5 cycles at n=7 (OPEN-Q-010) needs computational testing
- Computation library could be extended: inshat, per-path identity, arc-reversal testing

**Summary of work:** Built the full research directory system. Processed two uploaded source files as the first contributions. Extracted theorems F1–F5 and Claim A to canon. Logged MISTAKE-001. Opened DISC-001 as a potential court case seed (μ computation bug vs. paper's 0-failure verification claim).

- 00-navigation/TANGENTS.md, OPEN-QUESTIONS.md populated from source files
- 03-artifacts/drafts/parity_tournaments_fixed.tex archived
- 02-court/active/DISC-001-mu-bug-vs-verification.md opened
**Unresolved threads:**
- Claim A proof (the central open problem)
- Why does per-path identity hold at n=5 despite 5-cycles? (OPEN-Q-001)
- μ computation bug in scripts 6-9 needs investigation (DISC-001)
- Formal proof of Fix(σ) = 2^{m²} for self-evacuating SYT (OPEN-Q-007)
