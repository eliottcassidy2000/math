| HYP-012 | Sum_T F(T,x) = A_n(x) * 2^{C(n,2)-(n-1)} | Each perm is HP of 2^{extra} tournaments | worpitzky_restricted_eulerian.py |
| HYP-316 | beta_1*beta_3=0 (seesaw) — PROVED for n<=7 only | im(d_2) mediator: drops by 1 for beta_1>0, saturated for beta_3>0. Open for n>=8. | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-318 | ker(d_1) = C(n,2)-n+1 constant for all tournaments | im(d_1)=n-1 since tournaments weakly connected (Redei) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-320 | beta_1 in {0,1} only (never >1) | im(d_2) takes exactly 2 values, gap = 1 | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-322 | beta_2=0 for all tournaments | Exhaustive n<=6, 1000 samples n=7,8: 0 violations | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-323 | beta_5 first appears at n=8 | betti=[1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0] found at n=8 (~0.2%) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-324 | beta_4 can be >1 (value 5 observed at n=8) | Near-regular c3=20 tournament | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-325 | THM-119: Disjoint support at Omega_2 (PROVED) | Each 2-path has at most 1 NA face => constraint matrix full rank | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-326 | beta_2=0 at n=9 (0/500) and n=10 (0/100) | Extends HYP-249/276. Now confirmed n<=10 | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-327 | Removing 1 edge from tournament can create beta_2>0 | 13/500 at n=6 (2.6%). Completeness is SHARP condition | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-328 | 3-path NA face distribution converges to 25/50/25 | NOT per-tournament (transitive=100/0/0). Average over ensemble only. Max dev: 0.75(n=5)->0.21(n=8) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-336 | dim(Omega_2) = C(n,3) + 2*c3 - e_cyc | PROVED: THM-119 gives dim=|A2|-#NA; |A2|=C(n,3)+2*c3 (HYP-268); #NA = e_cyc (edges in 3-cycles). Exhaustive n=4,5,6 | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-337 | e_cyc NOT determined by c3 alone | Multiple e_cyc values per c3 at n=5,6 (depends on cycle arrangement/sharing) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-338 | Defect rate wave: beta_1 decreasing, beta_3 increasing with n | n=5: (29.7%,0%), n=6: (14.6%,1%), n=7: (5.8%,7.2%), n=8: (1%,21%) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-339 | Adjacent-odd seesaw: beta_{2k-1}*beta_{2k+1}=0 for ALL tournaments | PERFECT: 0 violations in 1500+ samples n=6-8. Includes β₁β₃, β₃β₅, β₅β₇ | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-340 | At most one nonzero beta_p (p>=1) in generic tournament | 99.8% at n=7, 100% at n=8 (500 samples). Rare exceptions: [1,1,0,0,1,0,0] at n=7 (0.1%) | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-341 | beta_4 onset at n=7 (not n=8) | beta_4=6 (Paley T_7) and beta_4=1 found at n=7 with 1000 samples (0.2%). Missed in earlier 200-sample runs | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| ~~HYP-342~~ | ~~beta_{2k-1} in {0,1} for ALL k~~ | **MOVED TO REFUTED**: beta_3=2 at n=8. Boolean only holds for k=1. See REFUTED section. | kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-343 | rank(d_2) takes exactly 2 values: {n-1, n} | EXHAUSTIVE n=6: {9,10}. Sampled n=7: {14,15}. rank(d_2)=n-1 iff beta_1=1. Equivalent to HYP-320 | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-344 | beta_3+beta_4 coexistence extremely rare at n=8 | 0/1000 in large sample (SVD crash after), 1/300 in separate run. Rate < 0.3%. When present: beta_5=0 always | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-345 | beta_3>0 forces beta_4=0 in generic tournaments | 43/43 at n=8 in first test, but 1 counterexample in 300 (beta_3=beta_4=1). MOSTLY true but not universal | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-346 | beta_4>0 requires self-complementary score sequence | ALL 25 beta_4>0 cases at n=8 (2000 samples) have SC scores. Very strong constraint | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-347 | beta_1+beta_5 coexistence at n=8 | Found 1/2000: betti=[1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0], scores=(3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4), c3=20, chi=-1. Extremely rare | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-348 | beta_3+beta_4 coexistence rate ~0.15% at n=8 | 3/2000 with profile [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]. All have SC scores | kind-pasteur-S45 |
| HYP-349 | rank(d_4) gap = ker(d_3) - rank(d_4) is always 0 or 1 | Exhaustive n=6 (32448 gap=0, 320 gap=1). Sampled n=7 (925/75), n=8 (255/45). Equivalent to beta_3 in {0,1} | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-350 | Good vertex existence for beta_3: exists v with beta_3(T\v)=0 when beta_3(T)>0 | TRUE when beta_3>0. But FAILS unconditionally: Paley T_7 has beta_3=0 with NO good vertex (240 counterexamples at n=7). Good vertex holds for non-Paley n=7 (exhaustive) | kind-pasteur-S46, corrected opus-S53 |
| HYP-351 | dim H_3(T,T\v) <= 1 for ALL tournaments T and ALL vertices v | **REFUTED at n=8** (HYP-401): dim=2 for all-good beta_3=2 tournaments. Exhaustive n=6: ALL 1920 pairs dim=1. n=7: dim in {0,1}. FAILS n>=8 | kind-pasteur-S46, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S49 |
| HYP-352 | LES isomorphism: beta_3(T\v)=0 implies beta_3(T) = dim H_3(T,T\v) | n=6 exhaustive: 1920/1920 perfect match. Follows from H_2(T\v)=0 + LES exactness | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-353 | beta_3 completely fragile at n=6: ALL 6 deletions give beta_3=0 | 320/320 exhaustive. At n=7: 24/44 fragile, 16/44 have 1 surviving, 4/44 have 2 surviving | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-354 | Quotient proportionality: all ker(d_3) basis vectors project proportionally to H_3 | Exhaustive n=6 Type B (240/240). Cokernel vector in ker(d_3) has dim 7 at n=6, varies by tournament | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-355 | H_3 generator at n=6 Type B uses ALL C(6,4)=15 vertex 4-subsets (36 paths) | 240/240 Type B. Type A uses 9 paths on 9 subsets. Structure rigid within isomorphism class | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-356 | beta_1=1 forces rank(d_4) = ker(d_3) exactly (perfect saturation, gap=0) | n=6: 4800/4800 (100%), n=7: 27/27 (100%). ker(d_3) ranges 3-18 (n=6) and 12-49 (n=7) but gap ALWAYS 0 when beta_1=1. This IS the seesaw: extra Omega_4 content fills extra ker(d_3) | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-357 | ker(d_3) = dim(Omega_3) - dim(Omega_2) + rank(d_2) (seesaw formula) | Exact formula, verified 32768/32768 at n=6. Follows from beta_2=0 (THM-108): rank(d_3)=ker(d_2) | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-358 | Good vertex selection rule: max c3(v) gives beta_3(T\v)=0 at 97.7% | n=7: 43/44 success. Bad vertices have LOW c3(v) (1-4 vs good's 4-7). Intuition: removing the most cyclic vertex disrupts H_3 | kind-pasteur-S46 |
| HYP-359 | Bad-vertex TT always rank-critical (for ALL n, not just zero-redundancy) | Exhaustive n=5 (120/120), n=6 (4320/4320). At n=6 redundancy=2-3 but bad-TT still RC. Witness: global 1-form w vanishing on all non-bad columns. | beta2_badtt_rc_n6.py |
| HYP-360 | At n=6 #bad=3: exactly 3 TTs are RC (1 BAD + 2 MIXED), rest redundant | Exhaustive: BAD=1.00 RC, MIXED=1.33 RC avg, GOOD=0.67 RC avg. Total RC=3.00 = redundancy complement | beta2_rc_mechanism.py |
| HYP-362 | Witness cocycle ζ = H₁ generator of flipped tournament T' | CONFIRMED 100%: n=5 (120/120), n=6 (200/200 sampled). ζ normalized to ⟨ζ,∂_bad⟩=1 is EXACTLY the H₁ class emerging after flip. | beta2_witness_cocycle.py |
| HYP-363 | #bad = Σ_v β₁(T\v) when β₁(T)=0 | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5 (720/720), n=6 (27968/27968). Each bad vertex contributes exactly 1 to the sum. | beta2_witness_cocycle.py |
| HYP-364 | Hidden cycle lifts span exactly #bad dimensions (never more) | CONFIRMED n=5 (480/480), n=6 (19488/19488). dim(lift span) = #bad always. | beta2_hyp282_test.py |
| HYP-365 | Hidden cycle z_v defects are purely local: only TTs involving v violated | CONFIRMED n=5: 100% of nonzero defects involve v. z_v is cocycle of T\v → trivially satisfies non-v TTs. | beta2_why_3_max.py |
| HYP-366 | coker(res_v) = 1 for ALL bad vertices (exactly 1 missing cocycle direction) | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5 (840/840 instances), n=6 (405/405 sampled). | beta2_hyp282_test.py |
| HYP-367 | Alternating sum of 3 hidden cycle lifts ∈ im(∂₂) (1-boundary) | CONFIRMED: z₁-z₂+z₃ is in im(∂₂) but NOT a coboundary. Being exact doesn't force dependency. | beta2_redei_telescope.py |
| HYP-368 | Non-bad vertex subtournaments have zero redundancy when #bad=3 (n=5) | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5: 240/240 non-bad T\\w have redundancy=0. At n=6: mixed (0,1,2). | beta2_redei_telescope.py |
| HYP-369 | Bad vertices biased toward HP endpoints (positions 0, n-1) | CONFIRMED n=5,6: endpoints ~30% overrepresented vs uniform. | beta2_redei_telescope.py |
| HYP-370 | All hidden cycle lifts z_v ∈ B₁ = im(∂₂) | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5 (480/480), n=6 (1000/1000): rank_C₁/B₁ = 0 for ALL. Each z_v is a linear combination of TT boundaries. The quotient C₁/B₁ sees NOTHING — lifts are independent WITHIN B₁, not outside it. | beta2_quotient_rank.py |
| HYP-372 | z_v MUST use bad-TT boundary (can't be expressed without it) | CONFIRMED 100%: n=5 (360/360), n=6 (84/84). Removing bad-TT column makes z_v inexpressible. Consistent with RC. | beta2_badtt_coeff.py |
| HYP-373 | Bad-TT coefficient |α_bad| = 1/√2 universal for all z_v | CONFIRMED n=5 (120 tournaments, all α = ±0.707107). |α_bad|/max|α| = 1.0 always. Sign pattern not determined by TT position. | beta2_badtt_coeff.py |
| HYP-371a | EXACT: H_3(T,T\v) = beta_3(T) - rank(i_*) when beta_2=0 | LES + beta_2(T\v)=0 gives delta=0, j_* surjective. Exact, not inequality. Verified n=6 exhaustive | opus-S52 |
| HYP-371b | beta_3(T)=2 impossible: requires ALL deletions beta_3=1, never occurs | **REFUTED at n=8** (kind-pasteur-S48): beta_3=2 CONFIRMED, profile (1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0), 4/5000 (0.08%). Scores: (2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5) and (3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4). All have good vertices. | opus-S52, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-371c | Relative dim(R_1)=n-1 always, ker(d_1^rel)=n-2 always | R_1 = arcs incident to v (fixed for tournaments). d_1^rel has rank 1 (projects to R_0={v}). | opus-S52 |
| HYP-375 | beta_3 <= 1 at n=9 (200 random samples, 0 violations) | **REFUTED at n=8 AND n=9** (kind-pasteur-S48): b3=2 at n=8 (4/5000=0.08%), b3=2 at n=9 (1/2000=0.05%). beta_3<=1 proved ONLY at n<=7 | kind-pasteur-S47, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-376 | 3 * H_3 cokernel generator has INTEGER coefficients in {-3,...,3} at n=6 | ALL 240 Type B tours: 3*coker rounds to exact integers. Multiplied by 3 = integer coefficients {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-377 | Type B cokernel |coefficient| pattern is UNIVERSAL (single pattern for all 240 tours) | Exactly ONE sorted |coeff| pattern across all Type B. 36 nonzero / 63 total. Values 1/3, 2/3, 1 | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-378 | Subtournament c3 count determines # paths per vertex set in cokernel: c3=1 → 2 nonzero, c3=2 → 3 nonzero | 100%: 720 instances of c3=1 with 2nz, 2160 of c3=2 with 3nz, at n=6 | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-379 | Hybrid numpy-int64 + mod-p Gauss gives 3.8x speedup at n=8 for beta_3 | Benchmark: SVD=175ms, hybrid=46.5ms. beta_1 TT-span 6.4x faster. | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-380 | i_* INJECTIVE when b3(T)=1 AND b3(T\v)=1: rank(i_*)=1, H_3^rel=0 | **REFUTED at n=8** (kind-pasteur-S48): rank(i_*)=0 found even with b4=0. Trials 613,627,877/5000 (seed 12345). Holds n<=7 only. NOT needed for beta_3<=1 proof (good vertex + Claim II suffices) | kind-pasteur-S47, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-381 | LES dichotomy: b3(T\v)=0 => (rank=0,H3rel=1); b3(T\v)=1 => (rank=1,H3rel=0) | **PARTIALLY REFUTED at n=8**: bad vertex half fails (rank=0 possible). Good vertex half STILL HOLDS. n<=7: perfect. n=8: good vertex part still works | kind-pasteur-S47, updated kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-382 | Relative dims at n=6 fully determined by type: Type A=(1,5,9,6,0,0), Type B=(1,5,12,14,8,3) | Exhaustive: 480 Type A pairs, 1440 Type B pairs. Rigid structure | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-383 | Bad vertices have δ(β₃)=0: adding v adds EQUAL kernel and im(d_4) | n=7: 71/71 bad vertices. Perfect saturation — T\v cycle orthogonal to new v-paths content | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-384 | Restriction res: Z₁(T)→⊕_v H₁(T\v) is SURJECTIVE (coker=0) for all β₁=0 tournaments | n=5 exhaustive (480/480), n=6 (85/85). rank(res)=#bad exactly. Each hidden cycle is detected by restriction. | beta2_global_les_test.py |
| HYP-385 | #bad ≤ 3 is SPECIFIC to β₁(T)=0; β₁=1 allows #bad up to n | n=5 EXHAUSTIVE: β₁=1→#bad∈{3,4,5}; β₁=0→#bad∈{0,1,2,3}. n=6: β₁=1→#bad∈{4,5,6}. When β₁=1, ALL n vertices can be bad. β₁=0 is essential. | beta2_image_dim_test.py |
| HYP-385b | #bad ≤ 3+β₁(T) (Grok's "compat-subspace" formula) | REFUTED: n=5 β₁=1 gives #bad=5 (24 tours), but 3+1=4. n=6 β₁=1 gives #bad=6, but 3+1=4. Actual max is n when β₁=1, not 3+β₁. | beta2_image_dim_test.py |
| HYP-385c | H₁(T)=0 imposes "3 global relations" on ⊕H₁(T\v), giving 3D compat-subspace S | REFUTED EXHAUSTIVELY with β₁=0 ONLY: d(T) spans ALL of R^n. All n standard basis vectors e_i appear (each vertex can be uniquely bad). n=5: 720 β₁=0 tours, span=5. n=6: 27968, span=6. n=7: 5000 sampled, span=7. No compat-subspace. | beta2_compat_subspace_test.py |
| HYP-387 | Score obstruction fails for beta_3=2 at n=7: 4 score seqs compatible | (2,2,2,3,4,4,4), (2,2,3,3,3,4,4), (2,3,3,3,3,3,4), (3,3,3,3,3,3,3) all allow all-deletions-beta_3=1 | opus-S53 |
| HYP-388 | Only Paley T_7 has all 7 deletions with beta_3=1 (EXHAUSTIVE) | 240/2097152 = all labelings of Paley. Betti=[1,0,0,0,6,0,0], all deletions=[1,0,0,1,0,0]. beta_3(T_7)=0 (not 2!) | opus-S53 |
| HYP-389 | Exactly 2 iso classes of beta_3=1 at n=6 | Type A: score(1,1,1,4,4,4), 80 tours, 2 c3, not SC. Type B: score(2,2,2,3,3,3), 240 tours, 8 c3, SC | opus-S53 |
| HYP-390 | HEREDITARY SEESAW: beta_3(T)=1 => beta_1(T\v)=0 for ALL vertices v | n=6 exhaustive: 1920/1920, n=7: 700/700. STRONGER than seesaw (b1*b3=0 per tournament). Forces H_2(T,T\v)=0 for ALL v | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-391 | chi_rel DICHOTOMY: good vertex => chi_rel=-1, bad vertex => chi_rel=0 | n=6: 1920/1920 chi_rel=-1 (all good). n=7: 316/316 good=-1, 34/34 bad=0. Follows from chi(T\v)=1 for good, 0 for bad | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-392 | Relative complex concentrated in degree 3: H_p^rel=0 for p!=3 when beta_3(T)=1 | H_0^rel=0 (i_* iso on H_0), H_1^rel=0 (j_* surj from H_1=0), H_2^rel=0 (beta_1_Tv=0), higher=0 at tested n. Forces H_3^rel = -chi_rel | kind-pasteur-S47 |
| HYP-404 | Score alone cannot predict beta_3(T\v): every score 0-6 has P(beta_3=1)>0 at n=7 | Sampled: all scores have 1-2% rate of beta_3=1 in deletion. No "guaranteed good" score | opus-S53 |
| HYP-405 | 3-cycle count is constant per score sequence for beta_3=1 at n=7 | 12 score seqs observed, each with unique c3 count. Follows from Rédei formula c3 = C(n,3) - Σ C(d_i,2) | opus-S53 |
| HYP-406 | Paley T_7 is the ONLY good-vertex-free tournament at n=7 (exhaustive) | 240/2097152 = all labelings of Paley. |Aut(T_7)|=21, 7!/21=240. All have beta_3=0. | opus-S53 |
| HYP-393 | beta_3 ≤ 1 at n=7 EXHAUSTIVE (2,097,152 tournaments) | Case 1: 2,096,912 with good vertex → LES gives ≤1. Case 2: 240 Paley → beta_3=0 directly | opus-S53 |
| HYP-394 | CONSECUTIVE SEESAW: beta_k * beta_{k+1} = 0 for ALL k≥1, ALL tournaments | **REFUTED at n=8** (kind-pasteur-S48): 3/2000 have beta_3=1 AND beta_4=1, confirmed by BOTH SVD and mod-p. Holds exhaustively n=6, sampled n=7 (3000). FAILS at n=8 (~0.15% rate). The opus proof architecture (LES reduction to H_4^rel=0) still works at n≤7 but not n≥8. | opus-S54, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-395 | BAD vertex ACYCLICITY: H_p(T,T\v) = 0 for ALL p when b3(T)=1 and b3(T\v)=1 | 80 b3=1 tournaments at n=7: 60/60 bad vertices have ALL relative homology = 0. FAILS at n=8: when rank(i_*)=0, H_4^rel=1 and H_3^rel=1. | opus-S54, updated kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-396 | H_4(T,T\v) = 0 for ALL vertices of beta_3=1 tournaments | Holds n=7 (560/560). FAILS at n=8: when rank(i_*)=0 and b4=0, H_4^rel=1 from LES. Paley T_7: H_4^rel=1 (exception, b3(T)=0) | opus-S54, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-397 | CORRECTED: beta_3<=1 ONLY at n<=7. b3=2 possible at n=8 | beta_3=2 at n=8: profile (1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0), 4/5000 (0.08%). Good vertices always exist even for b3=2 tours. The "good vertex + Claim II" argument is CIRCULAR (H_3^rel=b3 for good vertex). beta_3<=1 proved exhaustively only at n<=7 | kind-pasteur-S48 |
| HYP-398 | NEW BOUNDARIES TARGET ONLY NEW CYCLES: im(d_4^new) ∩ span(old ker_d3) ⊂ im(d_4^old) | **REFUTED at n=8** but with crucial nuance: (1) Fails for GOOD vertices (b3(T\v)=0) at high rate — irrelevant to proof. (2) Fails for ~0.65% of BAD vertices (5/767, seed 12345) — EXACTLY those with rank(i_*)=0 (HYP-404). (3) HOLDS for 99.35% of BAD vertices. kind-pasteur-S49 saw failures at GOOD vertices; opus-S56 targeting_n8 (seed 42, 61 BAD) saw no failures (sample too small for 0.65%). The equivalence HYP-398⟺rank(i_*)=1 is exact. HOLDS universally at n≤7 (34/34). | opus-S55, REFUTED kind-pasteur-S49, reconciled opus-S56 |
| HYP-399 | Embedded H_3(T\\v) generator = H_3(T) generator (mod boundaries) | n=7: 44/44 BAD vertices. The true H_3 generator of T\\v, when embedded in T, IS the H_3 generator of T (up to scalar, mod im(d_4)). H_3 is "inherited" from the deletion. | opus-S55 |
| HYP-400 | rank(i_*^p) = 0 for all p >= 1 except p=3 for BAD vertices (n=7,8) | n=7: 560 vertices, n=8: 120 vertices. ALL rank(i_*) at all degrees match exactly. But this holds only when beta_3(T)=1 (not beta_3=2). | opus-S55 |
| HYP-401 | Claim II FAILS at n=8: dim H_3(T,T\v) = 2 for all-good beta_3=2 tournaments | beta_3=2 with ALL 8 deletions b3=0 (score 3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4) => H_3(T,T\v)=b3(T)=2 for every v. Claim II (H_3^rel<=1) was backbone of n<=7 proof. Fails EXACTLY when beta_3=2. | kind-pasteur-S49 |
| HYP-402 | beta_3 <= 2 for ALL n (floor(n/4) bound) | n=8: max=2 (0.07%), n=9: max=2 (0.07%), consistent with floor(n/4). beta_3=2 has SC score at n=9 | kind-pasteur-S49 |
| HYP-403 | Two structural types of beta_3=2 at n=8: all-good (SC score) and mixed (non-SC score) | All-good: score (3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4), 8/8 good vertices. Mixed: score (2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5), 6/8 good + 2/8 bad. Both types confirmed in 5000-sample run | kind-pasteur-S49 |
| HYP-404 | HYP-398 ⟺ i_*-injectivity: extra_kills=0 iff rank(i_*)=1 at n=8 | 762 injective BAD vertices: ALL extra_kills=0. 5 non-injective: ALL extra_kills=1. The equivalence is exact. extra_kills=1 means new d_4 kills exactly the H_3(T\v) generator. | opus-S56 |
| HYP-405 | Cancellation mechanism: old-face proj of new d_4 almost always in im(d_4) | n=7: 26/28 BAD vertices, old-face proj stays in im(d_4). 2/28 cases: old-face reaches H_3 direction but new-face cancels exactly. Full boundary always in im(d_4) (28/28). | opus-S56 |
| HYP-406 | b4(T)=0 for ALL b3=1 tournaments at n=7 AND n=8 (500 samples each) | Seesaw b3*b4=0 holds in the b3=1 stratum even at n=8 (where coexistence exists at 0.15%). The 500-sample test misses the rare coexistence. | opus-S56 |
| HYP-407 | chi(T) ∈ {0, 1, 7} at n=7. chi=0 iff b1>0 or b3>0. chi=7 iff Paley (b4=6) | 5000 samples. chi=1 (87.6%), chi=0 (12.3%), chi=7 (0.02%). At n=8: chi ∈ {0,1,2,3}. chi>1 from b4>0 only. | opus-S56 |
| HYP-408 | Codim-1 universality: codim(im(d_4^T)\_old\_proj, ker(d_3^T)\_old\_proj) = 1 for ALL b3=1 tournaments and ALL BAD vertices | **PARTIALLY REFUTED at n=8** (opus-S59): holds 300/300 at n=7. At n=8: 397/400 codim=1, but 3/400 codim=0 (HYP-422). Codim-0 cases = ψ escaping im(d_4^Tv). UNIVERSAL at n≤7 only. | opus-S57, updated opus-S59 |
| HYP-409 | im(d_4^{T\v}) ⊂ im(d_4^T)\_old\_proj universally | 200/200 at n=7, 122/122 at n=8. Boundaries of T\v embed into old-coordinate boundaries of T. | opus-S57 |
| HYP-410 | rank(i_*)=0 iff old-projection of embedded H_3(T\v) gen ∈ im(d_4^T)\_old\_proj | Confirmed: all failures have emb\_old\_in\_im\_old=True; all successes have False. Combined with HYP-408 (codim=1), i_*-injectivity reduces to a single linear condition. | opus-S57 |
| HYP-411 | Failure vertices have H_3(T) generator concentrated on through-v paths | Failures: 12-18 through-v path support vs success mean 9.3. Jaccard similarity of gen supports: fail 0.000-0.038 vs success mean 0.048. When H_3(T) gen relies heavily on v-paths, the embedded gen (which avoids v-paths) misaligns. | opus-S57 |
| HYP-412 | Ghost Cycle Theorem: every through-v-only cycle in ker(d_3) is in im(d_4), for b3=1 tournaments at n≤7 | n=6: trivially (no tv-only cycles). n=7: 450/450 (100%). n=8: 399/400 (99.75%). The ~0.25% failure at n=8 = rank(i_*)=0 mechanism. | opus-S58 |
| HYP-413 | Ghost Cycle ⟺ HYP-408: Ghost Cycle Theorem is EQUIVALENT to codim-1 universality, given beta_3=1 | PROVED: dim(K_tv)-dim(B_tv) = beta_3 - codim_old. Since B_tv ⊂ K_tv, equal dims ⟹ equal subspaces. Verified algebraic identity 1408/1408 across n=6,7,8. | opus-S58 |
| HYP-414 | rank(i_*: H_3(T\v)→H_3(T)) = β₃(T\v) exactly, for β₃(T)=1 tournaments | **PARTIALLY REFUTED at n=8** (opus-S59): 602/602 at n=7 ✓, but 400/400 at n=8 was SAMPLING ARTIFACT. Safe-arithmetic verification: 1199/1200 at n=8 with 2-method cross-validation (both methods agree 1200/1200). ~0.3% failure rate at n=8. n=7 confirmed universal. | kind-pasteur-S50, updated opus-S59 |
| HYP-415 | Ghost Cycle holds universally (WITH safe arithmetic): K_tv = B_tv for ALL β₃(T)=1 pairs | **PARTIALLY REFUTED at n=8**: 602/602 n=7 ✓. 400/400 at n=8 was insufficient sample (expected ~1.2 failures in 400). Safe arithmetic opus-S59: 199/200 at n=8 (full_relative_homology.py), 497/500 (relative_exactness_safe.py). Opus-S59's n=7 "failures" WERE overflow artifacts; n=8 failures ARE GENUINE. | kind-pasteur-S50, updated opus-S59 |
| HYP-416 | Block triangularity: D_{old→tv} = 0 and P_{old→tv} = 0 universally in boundary and constraint matrices | D_to=0: old p-paths have only old (p-1)-faces. P_to=0: old (p-1)-face non-allowedness only involves old p-paths. 301/301 n=7, 104/104 n=8. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-417 | H_3 generator old component is NEVER zero for β₃(T)=1 tournaments | 0/403 at n=7 (Case 2: β₃(T\v)=0). Every H_3 class has nontrivial old-path support. D_{3,tv→tv}(z_tv)=0 always; old component NOT a cycle in T\v. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-418 | Paley T_7 Fourier structure: each non-trivial eigenspace k=1,...,6 contributes exactly 1 to β_4=6 | Verified by Fourier eigenspace decomposition. Trivial eigenspace (k=0) has β=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. All 6 non-trivial eigenspaces identical β=[0,0,0,0,1,0,0]. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-419 | T_3 Fourier: only trivial eigenspace (k=0) has nonzero Betti: β=[1,1,0] | Verified. k=1,2 contribute nothing. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-420 | ~~β_{n-2} generically nonzero at n=8~~ | **REFUTED** (kind-pasteur-S50): opus used max_deg=6, missing im(d_7). With max_deg=7: β_6=0 for ALL 50/50 (rk(d_7)=ker(d_6) exactly). β_{n-2}=0 for ALL n<=8. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-421 | H_4^rel = 0 universally at n=7, FAILS at n=8 | **CONFIRMED with safe arithmetic**: n=7: 200/200. n=8: 1/200 failure (full_relative_homology.py), 2/300 (relative_exactness.py). Relative d_5 surjects onto ker(d_4^rel) at n=7 (slack=0, 200/200). From LES: H_4^rel = ker(i_*: H_3(T\v)→H_3(T)). | opus-S59 |
| HYP-422 | ψ(ker) escapes im(d_4^Tv) at n=8, never at n=7 | **CONFIRMED with safe arithmetic**: n=7: 200/200 containment, codim=0 (200/200). n=8: 3/500 escapes (safe). Verified by 2-method cross-validation: both ψ-method and direct-embedding agree 1200/1200. | opus-S59 |
| HYP-423 | TOP INJECTIVITY: d_{n-1} injective on Omega_{n-1} for ALL tournaments | 1772/1772 (n=3-8). rk(d_{n-1})=dim(Omega_{n-1}) always. Consequence: β_{n-1}=β_{n-2}=0 universally. Also ker(d_{n-2})=dim(Omega_{n-1}). | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-424 | TOP VANISHING: β_{n-1}=β_{n-2}=0 for ALL tournaments on n>=3 vertices | Follows from HYP-423. Verified n=3-8 (1772 samples, 0 failures). Sharp: β_{n-3} CAN be nonzero (β_3 at n=6, β_4 at n=7 Paley). | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-425 | β_4(T) = 0 for ALL tournaments at n ≤ 7 | 1000/1000 at n=5, 1000/1000 at n=6, 1000/1000 at n=7. At n=8: β_4=1 in 5/500 (1%). ALL β_4>0 cases at n=8 have β_3=0. β_4=0 for all b3=1 tournaments even at n=8 (83/83). Simplifies LES: 0 → H_4^rel → H_3(T\v) → H_3(T). | opus-S59 |
| HYP-426 | ψ(ker(d_4^{tv→tv})) = im(d_4^{T\v}) exactly at n=7 | codim = 0 in 200/200 cases with safe arithmetic. The old-projection of relative-cycle boundaries spans EXACTLY the boundary image of T\v. Not a proper subspace — full equality. This is stronger than just ⊂. | opus-S59 |
| HYP-427 | Relative complex C_*(T, T\v) acyclic at n=7 for b3=b3_Tv=1 | All β_p^rel = 0 for all p. 100/100. Inclusion T\v ↪ T is a homology equivalence. Equivalent to i_*-injectivity since only β_3 is nonzero. | opus-S59 |
| HYP-428 | χ(T, T\v) = 5 constant for all b3=1 n=7 tournaments | 100/100 (including C_0, C_1 terms). Full χ^rel = 0 when including Ω_0, Ω_1. At n=8, χ^rel varies (7-21). | opus-S59 |
| HYP-429 | Neither d_4^{old→old} nor d_4^{tv→old} alone surjects onto im(d_4^{T\v}) | 0/200 at n=7, 0/300 at n=8 for either block alone. The surjection requires interplay between both blocks with massive cancellation (rk_oo≈9, rk_to≈9, but rk_combined≈4 at n=7). | opus-S59 |
| HYP-430 | Paley T_11: β_0-4 = (1,0,0,0,0) exact, β_5 ≤ 3400 | Direct computation via full_chain_complex_modp with increasing max_deg. max_deg=5 took 420s. Omega dims=[11,55,220,770,2255,5060]. First nonzero β beyond β_0 is at degree ≥ 5. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-431 | Paley T_p: Omega_k = Omega_{p-k} for k=1,...,p-1 (palindrome) | **PARTIALLY-TRUE**: T_7 confirmed [7,21,42,63,63,42,21]. **REFUTED for T_11**: Omega_5^(eig)=460 but Omega_6^(eig)=700 (not 460). Per-eigenspace chi=-309 through degree 5; chi=1 per eigenspace forces sum_{m=7}^{10} (-1)^m Omega_m^(eig) = -390. For T_3: FAILS trivially. Palindrome holds ONLY for T_7 among p=3,7,11. Palindrome was motivated by self-converse symmetry, but that only implies Omega_m = Omega_{p-1-m} not Omega_m = Omega_{p-m}. | kind-pasteur-S50, REFUTED for T_11 kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-437 | ALL eigenspaces of T_p have IDENTICAL Omega dims for k=0,...,p-1 | T_7: [1,3,6,9,9,6,3] same for all 7 eigenspaces. T_11: [1,5,20,70,205,460] same for all 11 eigenspaces (degrees 0-5). Follows from Paley multiplicative symmetry: QR-multiplication acts transitively on all eigenspaces (including k=0) via self-converse anti-automorphism. EXPLAINS palindrome: Omega_m = p * per-eigenspace dim. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-432 | chi(T_p) = p for Paley primes p≥7 | PROVED for T_7 (chi=7 from Omega dims). Conjectured T_11 (chi=11). Proof: palindrome Omega_k=Omega_{p-k} + odd p makes all pairs cancel => chi=Omega_0=p. Also: chi = sum (-1)^k β_k confirms T_7 since 1-0+0-0+6-0+0=7=p. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-433 | T_p Betti: β_{(p+1)/2} = p-1, all other β_k=0 for k>=1 | T_7: β_4=6=p-1 at degree (7+1)/2=4. CONSISTENT WITH chi=7. Fourier: p-1 non-trivial eigenspaces each contribute 1. T_11 PARTIAL COMPUTATION: ker(d_6^(k=0))=395, ker(d_6^(k≠0))=391. Total ker(d_6)=4305. If β_6=10, need im(d_7^(k≠0))=390 per non-trivial eigenspace and im(d_7^(k=0))=395. This means rk(d_7)≈4295 out of Omega_7^(eig)≈? (extremely high rank ratio). UNVERIFIED — need im(d_7) computation. chi constraint: β_6-β_5+β_8-β_7+...=10. | kind-pasteur-S50, needs im(d_7) computation |
| HYP-438 | T_11 Omega_7 per eigenspace satisfies sum_{m=7}^{10} (-1)^m Omega_m^(eig) = -390 | Forced by chi=1 per eigenspace: partial chi through deg 6 = 391, chi must equal 1. Unknown Omega_7^(eig); needs computation. For chi to work: -Omega_7+Omega_8-Omega_9+Omega_10 = -390. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-439 | T_11 per-eigenspace palindrome is Omega_m^(eig) = Omega_{10-m}^(eig) (Poincaré at p-1=10) | Analogy: T_7 palindrome is Omega_m=Omega_{6-m}. T_11 palindrome would be Omega_m=Omega_{10-m}. But Omega_5=460 ≠ Omega_5=460 (need Omega_10=460, Omega_9=205, Omega_8=70, Omega_7=20, Omega_6=5? No — Omega_6=700 ≠ 5). So REFUTED immediately. The palindrome does NOT hold at degree 5 vs degree 5 mirror (10-5=5 = same), but degree 6 mirror would be 10-6=4, and Omega_4=205 ≠ 700=Omega_6. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-434 | chi(T) distribution at n=8: chi=1 (81.75%), chi=0 (17.55%), chi=2 (0.65%), chi=3 (0.05%) | 2000 random tournaments, full complex max_p=7. chi=2 from β_4=1, chi=3 from β_4=2. chi=3 ONLY from near-regular score (3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4) with c3=20 (maximum). No chi<0 or chi>3 seen. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-435 | β_4>0 requires c3 >= 16 at n=8 (out of max 20) | 2000 samples: c3 range for β_4=1 is 16-20, most common c3=18,19. β_4=2 only at c3=20. Highly cyclic structure required. Contrast: β_3>0 allows c3 as low as 7. | kind-pasteur-S50 |
| HYP-436 | Unique chi=3 tournament has β_4=2, score (3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4), c3=20 | In 2000 samples, exactly 1 tournament had chi=3. Regular-adjacent score (differs by 1 from regular) with max possible c3=20. Consistent with earlier HYP-324 (β_4=5 at c3=20 from regular score). | kind-pasteur-S50 |

| HYP-303 | Filling ratio f_p = dim(Omega_p)/C(n,p+1) > 1 for p >= 3 at n >= 6 | CONFIRMED: f_3 = 1.048 (n=6), 1.157 (n=7), 1.283 (n=8). Cyclic content inflates beyond simplex. | filling_ratio_formula.py |
| HYP-304 | H(T_4) = 2*c3 + 1 for ALL 4-vertex tournaments | CONFIRMED exhaustive (64/64). Clean identity: H(transitive)=1, H(cyclic)=3, H(regular)=5. | chi_A_identity.py |
| HYP-305 | excess_4 = 2*c3*(n-3) for ALL tournaments on n vertices | CONFIRMED n=4-7 exhaustive/sampled. Each 3-cycle in (n-3) 4-subsets; H(T_4) identity gives 2 per cycle. | chi_A_identity.py |
| HYP-306 | chi_A = sum(-1)^p \|A_p\| is ALWAYS ODD | CONFIRMED n=3-7. All tournaments at all n have odd chi_A. | chi_A_identity.py |
| HYP-307 | chi_A = 1 at n=4 for ALL tournaments (tournament-independent) | CONFIRMED exhaustive (64/64). Perfect cancellation: 2*c3 - 2*c3 = 0. | chi_A_identity.py |
| HYP-308 | dim(Omega_2) is NOT determined by c3 alone at n >= 5 | CONFIRMED: (c3=4, score=(1,2,2,2,3)) at n=5 gives Omega_2 in {8,9,10}. Geometric arrangement matters. | omega2_formula.py |
| HYP-309 | dim(Omega_2) is NOT determined by (c3, score) at n >= 5 | CONFIRMED: same (c3, score) at n=5,6 gives different Omega_2 values. Path complex encodes more than cycle/score data. | omega2_formula.py |
| HYP-310 | Dimensional crossover: P(beta_1>0) peaks then decays; P(beta_3>0) grows monotonically from d=5 | CONFIRMED: P(b1>0) = 25%, 37.5%, 25%, 15.8%, 5.4%, 1.7% for n=3-8. P(b3>0) = 0, 0.98%, 8.7%, 18.7% for n=5-8. Crossover at d=6. | dimensional_crossover.py |
| HYP-311 | beta_3 fragility: beta_3>0 disappears under ANY vertex deletion at n=6 | CONFIRMED exhaustive. All 320 beta_3>0 tournaments at n=6 have trivial betti for all 6 deletions. beta_1 can survive deletion (robust). | simplex_face_restriction.py |
| HYP-312 | chi(T) in {0,1} for ALL tournaments at n <= 7 | CONFIRMED: n=3-7 exhaustive/sampled. chi=0 iff beta_1=1 or beta_3=1. Breaks at n=8 (chi up to 6 from beta_4). | euler_char_scaling.py |
| HYP-313 | Non-SC tournaments always have chi=1 at n <= 6 | CONFIRMED exhaustive. At n=7, first non-SC with chi=0 appears. | euler_char_scaling.py |
| HYP-314 | surplus = excess_paths - rank(constraints) exactly for all p | CONFIRMED n=5-7 for p=2,3. Identity is algebraic: dim(Omega_p) = |A_p| - rank(P_p). | local_redei_investigation.py |
| HYP-315 | corr(surplus, excess_H) increases with n at fixed p | CONFIRMED: p=2 correlation goes 0.53 (n=6) -> 0.87 (n=7). Cyclic content increasingly predicts Omega inflation. | local_redei_investigation.py |
| HYP-329 | dim(Z₁) = C(n,2)-(n-1) universal for all tournaments | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5,6,7. rank(∂₁)=n-1 always (complete underlying graph). β₁ depends entirely on rank(∂₂). Note: equivalent to HYP-318 | beta2_rank_critical.py |
| HYP-330 | rank(∂₂\|Ω₂) = C(n,2)-n+1-β₁ | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5 (1024/1024), n=6 (32768/32768). Zero violations. | beta2_rank_critical.py |
| HYP-331 | dim(ker(∂₂^T)) = n-1+β₁ | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5,6. Clean dual formula. | beta2_bad_tt_basis.py |
| HYP-332 | Bad-vertex TT is rank-critical (removing drops rank(∂₂)) | CONFIRMED exhaustive n=5,6: n=5 (120/120), n=6 (4320/4320). At n=5: zero redundancy (all TTs RC). At n=6: redundancy∈{2,3} but bad-TT STILL RC. Bad verts always form TT, never 3-cycle. | beta2_badtt_rc_n6.py |
| HYP-333 | #RC=0 when redundancy (#TTs-rank) ≥ threshold | CONFIRMED: threshold=3 at n=5, =8 at n=6. Note: #bad=3 at n=5→redundancy=0, at n=6→redundancy∈{2,3} (nonzero). | beta2_rank_critical.py |
| HYP-334 | Flip obstruction: 3-cycle among ALL bad vertices forces β₁≥1 | CONFIRMED: 0 counterexamples at n=5 (720), n=6 (27968), n=7 (479). Flipping bad TT→3-cycle: 100% force β₁=1 | beta2_flip_deep.py |
| HYP-335 | Minimum #bad when β₁=1 grows with n | CONFIRMED: min_bad=3(n=5), 4(n=6), 5(n=7). β₁=1 bad sub-tournament often SC (55% at n=6) | beta2_flip_deep.py |
