GLMY PATH HOMOLOGY v2 — Fixed implementation

Fixes from v1:
- Omega_0 = A_0 (boundary ∂_0 = 0 by convention, so all 0-paths are ∂-invariant)
- Cleaner handling of the chain complex at dimension 0

DEFINITIONS (GLMY):
- Elementary p-path: sequence (v_0, ..., v_p) of DISTINCT vertices
- ALLOWED p-path: one where v_i -> v_{i+1} is a directed edge for all i
- Boundary: ∂(v_0...v_p) = sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^i (v_0...v̂_i...v_p)
- A_p = vector space spanned by allowed p-paths
- Ω_p = {u ∈ A_p : ∂u ∈ A_{p-1}}  (for p ≥ 1; Ω_0 = A_0)
- H_p^{path}(G) = ker(∂_p: Ω_p → Ω_{p-1}) / im(∂_{p+1}: Ω_{p+1} → Ω_p)
